                    <h1>About Craig and Mick</h1>
                    <p>In 2011, Milwaukee Public Schools suffered a tremendous loss, when Craig Belcher passed away. Craig was a conference champion wrestling coach and a valued mentor, and was inducted into the Wisconsin Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2012. He was an avid participant in city youth wrestling, both as a referee and as a coach, and left a legacy that spans over 20 years in Milwaukee Public Schools.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In 2016, MPS lost another valued member in Coach Mick Gutowski. Just like Coach Belcher, Gutowski was a conference champion coach and a pervasively positive influence. Between the two, there are over 40 years of victories on and off the field.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As educators, Craig Belcher and Mick Gutowski exemplified public education at its best. They were each committed to bettering themselves as leaders, educators, and people. They believed in progress and the fundamentals of study and instruction. They were concerned with the futures of their students, and were diligently involved in those students' day-to-day lives.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As coaches, Craig Belcher and Mick Gutowski emphasized sportsmanship alongside sport. They taught their athletes to focus on self-improvement and effort, and to avoid regret. To them, work brought individual success, and cooperation brought success as a team.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As members of the community, they each found comfort and realization in the lives of their friends and family, and the growth of those people they held most dear. "Do your best, and your best will do the rest."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To honor them, we have created a scholarship fund in their names. A $1000, 4-year scholarship to an MPS wrestler who is committed to community and a secondary education.</p>
